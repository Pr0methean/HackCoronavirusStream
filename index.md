## Why

The COVID-19 coronavirus is likely to evolve resistance to remdesivir, other antiviral drugs,
and even the vaccines currently being tested. We need a treatment that can keep up with the
virus's evolution, while keeping the risk of side effects low. RNA editing makes that possible.

The [Hack Coronavirus](https://github.com/bionicles/coronavirus) project, run by scientist Bion
Howard and software engineer Chris Hennick, is developing plasmids and delivery methods which
will seek and destroy specific RNA sequences that are found in the virus, but not in healthy
human cells, all using public data and open-source software.

Like all medical treatments, these plasmids need to be tested in vitro and/or in animals,
followed by human trials and then approval for clinical use. We're raising money for the first
phase: in-vitro and animal testing. All proceeds from the stream will be administered by
an established foundation (which will be named closer to the stream date) and used for lab
testing of RNA-editing COVID-19 treatments.
